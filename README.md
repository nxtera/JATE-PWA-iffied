## What was my motivation?
To build my first full-stack PWA that can also function offline.

## What did I do?
Expanded on the starter code to use the npm package idb, utilise service worker functionality and ensure the webpack file was properly configured. 

## What did I learn?
- How to use IndexedDB to create an object store and includes both GET and PUT methods.
- How to ensure applications work offline by using service worker with workbox that caches static assets.
- How to enable apps to be installed as PWAs. 

## Usage
Go to the app's homepage here:

https://jate-pwa-iffied.herokuapp.com/

Click on the install button to install the app to the desktop to be used as a PWA.
